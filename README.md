# Safety & Security
>
> ❗ You should only use this plugin with those you trust

If you have gotten this far, it is no secret that this plugin interacts in a very invasive, and automated way with your client. While our team attempts to make this as safe as possible, it is up to you to ensure that you trust your partners.

### 📖 Open Source

All of the code is uploaded on to github here. You can build and compile your own, or verify anything you like about the behavior of the client or server. I believe that this is one of the most important steps to earning trust with this tool.

Additionally server packages are provided should you prefer to host your own tools. While we cannot guarantee to assist with directly bringing up the server. Template files using docker compose are provided as-is.

### ⚙️ Permissions

Robust user pairing and permissions ensures that you give permissions only as you require.

### 🛡️ Safe Word

Functionality found in the settings tab to immediately disable the plugin and refuse any further or pending actions.

### ✅ Server Authoritative

This is a server centered plugin. You will need to join and register with a server prior to being able to make use of this plugin. If you do not wish to join one, you may host your own.

# Community Driven

This project aims to be primarily driven by those that wish to contribute and assist in the future.

All contributions are welcome, but please read the contribution guide and read out on our discord before attempting to fork and make a PR.

# About The Plugin

KinkLink is a new community drive project inspired by [ProjectGagspeak](https://github.com/Project-GagSpeak/) and built upon the foundations of [AetherRemote](http://github.com/aetherremote/AetherRemote/) projects. I am deeply indepted to both projects for providing the foundations that I walk on. I merely stand on the shoulders of giants as I build this.
